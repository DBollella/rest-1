# Rest: building REST APIs using Haskell

The 'rest' set of packages allow you to write REST APIs in Haskell. You can run these APIs in
various web frameworks, like Happstack or Snap. You can also automatically generate documentation
from these APIs, ensuring that it always matches your code. Similarly, you can generate client
libraries for different languages like Javascript or Haskell.

## Getting started

To get started, you can read our [tutorial](tutorial.html).
